### Textbook

The class has one required textbook: ***Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, 3rd Edition by Bryant and O'Hallaron***. We will also be using an online Wikibook, [C Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming), when we learn about C programing.

### Learning Resources

Here are some other resources that might help you:

- *The* original book on C, [The C Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0131103628/).

- Jan Schaumann has a lot of great videos on [Advance Programming in the UNIX Environment](https://www.youtube.com/@cs631apue/videos).

- Ben Eater has some great [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater) on how to build a computer, write assembly, and other computer topics.
  
- [Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=computerphile) has approachable videos on various computing topics.

- Chris has some tutorials on various Linux topics on his [blog](https://kitras.io).

### Linux Command Summary
For more information on the following commands, type `man` and the name of the command to see a help manual for that command. You can open another terminal window at the same time to type the `man` command and see the helpful text. Some commands, like `alias`, are built into bash. For these, type `man bash` to get help. If you type `man <command>` and the response is `No manual entry for <command>`, it is likely built into bash. Online help is also available for [shell built-in commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Builtin-Commands.html) and [other core commands](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/index.html).
