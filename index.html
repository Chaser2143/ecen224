        <p class="info">MWF, 9–9:50 AM<br>
            Th, 12–2:50 PM<br>
            4 credits<br>
            Class is listed as ECEn 493R section 2</p>


        <p>I, Dr. Lundrigan, am piloting a new class sophomore-level class, ECEn
            224, and I need your help! I need motivated students that are interested
            in shaping the sophomore student experience for years to come. The class
            will be taught full time starting next year (Fall 2023). In the
            meantime, I would like to get a feel for how students enjoy the content,
            labs, class pacing, etc. I am looking for about 20 intersted sophmore
            students to help pilot this class. If you are intersted, contact me at
            lundrigan@byu.edu.</p>

        The class will cover the following topics:
        <ul>
            <li><b>C Programming</b>. After taking this class, you will be an advance C programmer.</li>
            <li><b>Machine Representation</b>. You will learn how a computer translates a C program into a machine code
            </li>
            <li><b>Computer Organization</b>. Learn how computers are structured to be efficient and flexible.</li>
            <li><b>Complex System</b>. The semester project is to build a smart doorbell system. You will gain
                experience with connecting multiple systems to build something really cool.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>What credit do I get for taking this class?</h3>
        <p>You get credit for ECEn 323. If you are an EE student and was not planning on taking ECEn 323, then it can
            count toward ECEn 220. If you have already taken ECEn 220, then it will count as credit for ECEn 424.</p>

        <h3>What are the prerequisites for this class?</h3>
        <p>CS 111 (or CS 142)</p>

        <h3>What will I learn about in this class?</h3>
        Here are the learning objectives
        <ul>
            <li><b>Binary Representation and Computation</b>. Ability to represent numbers in binary and perform binary
                operations.</li>
            <li><b>C Programming</b>. Ability to program using the C programming language.</li>
            <li><b>Machine Representation of Programs</b>. Ability to represent programs in assembly language, translate
                between C and assembly language, and evaluate security vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><b>Computer Organization</b>. Ability to identify basic computer components, including memory hierarchy,
                I/O, and central processing unit (CPU), and explain how these components work together to create a
                computer system.</li>
            <li><b>I/O Programming</b>. Ability to build a system that securely interacts with I/O devices and computer
                networks through C programming.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Is there a book?</h3>
        <p>Yes, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X">Computer
                Systems: A Programmer's Perspective 3E</a>.</p>

        <h3>How do I join the class?</h3>
        <p>The class is add-code only so you will need to email me (lundrigan@byu.edu) to join the class.</p>

        <h3>Why is the class listed as ECEn 493R?</h3>
        <p>Since this is a pilot class, it gets a temporary course number, 493R. Next year, it will have its normal
            number, 224.</p>
